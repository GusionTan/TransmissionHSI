# TransmissionHSI
## 1、Introduction
This project is used to study the image processing method of hyperspectral imaging in projection mode.  
First, we performed **transmission** hyperspectral imaging of the fluorescent molecules.

## 2、Work
a. A transmission-based method was used for background material separation.  
b. A new feature for hyperspectral classification is proposed.  
c. Verify the validity and accuracy of the new features on most classification algorithms, including knn、svm、sae、clstm、hybird、ssan etc.  

## 3、Process
